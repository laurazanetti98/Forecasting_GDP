# Forecasting_GDP

The dataset under consideration contains estimates of total GDP (gross domestic product) and its components for several countries over the period 1970-2020. Information are available for 220 countries and 17 different indicators were derived. The main aim of this project is to forecast the total GDP for the last 10 years (2010-2020), for five different states: Italy, United States, India, Singapore,China and United Kingdom. In order to do that we are gonna use different models (Linear Regression, ETS models and ARIMA) and compare them in terms of AIC and RMSE. We are also gonna visualize and analyze some other (italian) variables other than the GDP as: Exports, Imports, Manufacturing (ISIC D) and Gross capital formation.

Glossary

* **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** --> the total of all value added created in an economy.
* **Gross capital formation** --> consists of outlays on additions to the fixed assets of the economy plus net changes in the level of inventories
* **Imports of goods and services** --> represent the value of all goods and other market services received from the rest of the world.
* **Exports of goods and services** --> represent the value of all goods and other market services provided to the rest of the world.
* **Manufacturing (ISIC D)** --> is the net output of a sector after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs.

The project is divided in 4 main sections:
1.Project exploration and cleaning
2.Data Visualization
3.Decomposition of italian variables
4.Models for forecasting
